## **Setting up, getting started**

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `/delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<br></br>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `InternshipApplicationListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `InternshipApplication` object residing in the `Model`.

The `HelpWindow` component is shown when you execute a help command. It contains a link to the detailed user and developer guide on this HireMe documentation website.

The `ChartWindow` component is shown when you execute a chart command. It contains a visual representation of the various statuses of your internship applications, in the form of a pie chart.

<br></br>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a internship application).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<br></br>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component:

- **Stores HireMe application data**, which includes all `InternshipApplication` objects. These objects are stored in a UniqueList, ensuring that each application is unique.
- **Manages a filtered list** of currently 'selected' `InternshipApplication` objects (e.g., search results) as a separate, _filtered_ list. This filtered list is exposed as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<InternshipApplication>`, allowing the UI to automatically reflect any changes in the data, as the list is observable.
- **Stores a `UserPrefs` object**, representing the userâ€™s preferences. This object is exposed externally as a `ReadOnlyUserPrefs`, ensuring that the preferences can be accessed but not modified directly.
- **Is self-contained**, meaning that the `Model` does not depend on any other external components. As it represents the core domain entities, it maintains logical independence to ensure modularity and encapsulation.

<br></br>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

<br></br>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.hireme.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Getting help
The implementation of the command follows the convention of a normal command, where `AddressBookParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string into an executable command.
In this case, since there are no additional parameters for the help command, `AddressBookParser` does not create any parser object.

<puml src="diagrams/HelpSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="HelpSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` ensures that there are no additional keywords provided. If there are keywords found, `AddressBookParser` throws a ParseException.
Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `HelpCommand`.

Upon execution, `HelpCommand` returns an instance of `CommandResult` which contains the help message.

> **_NOTE:_** `Model` is not invoked here but included for the sake of clarity.

<br></br>

### Create new internship application
The implementation of the create command follows the convention of a normal command, where `AddressBookParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string into an executable command.
In this case, `AddressBookParser` creates `AddCommandParser` to parse user input string.

<puml src="diagrams/AddSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` first obtains the values corresponding to the prefixes `n/`, `r/`, `e/` and `d/`.
`AddressBookParser` ensures that:
- All values corresponding to the prefixes are valid
  If any of the above constraints are violated, `AddressBookParser` throws a ParseException. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `AddCommand` that corresponds to the user input.
`AddCommand` comprises of the internship application to be added, which is an instance of `InternshipApplication`.

Upon execution, `AddCommand` first queries the supplied model if it contains a duplicate internship application. If no duplicate internship application exists, then `AddCommand` adds the internship application into the data.

> **_NOTE:_** HireMe identifies an entry as a duplicate if its `NAME`, `ROLE`, `EMAIL` and `DATE` match **(case-insensitive)** with those of an existing internship application entry. Attempting to add a duplicate will result in an error.

<br></br>

### List all internship applications
The implementation of the list command follows the convention of a normal command, where `AddressBookParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string into an executable command.

<puml src="diagrams/ListSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ListSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` creates `ListCommand`
Upon execution, `ListCommand` calls on `model::updateFilteredList` to show all internship applications.

<br></br>

### Delete an internship application

The implementation of the delete command follows the convention of a normal command, where `AddressBookParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string into an executable command.

In this case, `AddressBookParser` creates `DeleteCommandParser` to parse user input string.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="DeleteSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` first obtains the index from the user's input.
`AddressBookParser` ensures that there is only 1 keyword found which is a number. If there is no valid keyword found, `AddressBookParser` throws a ParseException.
Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `DeleteCommand` that corresponds to the user input.
`DeleteCommand` comprises of a targetIndex which is the zero based index number of the internship application to be deleted.

Upon execution, `DeleteCommand` gets the internship application to be deleted and calls on `model::deleteItem` which deletes it from the list.
> **_NOTE:_** The sequence diagram shows a simplified execution of the DeleteCommand.

<br></br>

### Update the status of an internship application
The `StatusCommand` updates the status of an internship application to `PENDING`, `ACCEPTED`, or `REJECTED`, triggered by commands `/pending`, `/accept`, or `/reject` respectively. The implementation of the status command follows the convention of a normal command, where `AddressBookParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string into an executable command.

In this case, `AddressBookParser` creates `StatusCommandParser` to parse user input string.

![StatusSequenceDiagram](diagrams/StatusSequenceDiagram.puml)

The sequence diagram above illustrates the flow for the `/accept` command. Similar flows apply for `/reject` and `/pending`.

`AddressBookParser` first obtains the index from the user's input.  
`AddressBookParser` ensures that there is only one keyword found, which is a number. If no valid keyword is found, `AddressBookParser` throws a `ParseException`. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `StatusCommand` based on the user input, with the `StatusCommand` containing the target index and specified status.

Upon execution, `StatusCommand` retrieves the internship application to be updated and calls `model::setItem` to update the status within the list.
<puml src="diagrams/StatusActivityDiagram.puml" alt="StatusActivityDiagram" />
> **_NOTE:_** The sequence diagram shows a simplified execution of the StatusCommand.

The activity diagram above outlines the detailed flow for the `StatusCommand`, showing the decision points and actions taken during the command execution.

<br></br>

### Find internship applications
The implementation of the find command follows the convention of a normal command, where `AddressBookParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string into an executable command.
In this case, `AddressBookParser` creates `FindCommandParser` to parse user input string.

<puml src="diagrams/FindSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="FindSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` first obtains the keyword from the user's input.
`AddressBookParser` ensures that there is at least 1 keyword found. If there is no keyword found, `AddressBookParser` throws a ParseException.
Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `FindCommand` that corresponds to the user input.
  `FindCommand` comprises of a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`.

Upon execution, `FindCommand` calls on `model::updateFilteredList` which in turns calls on `filteredList::setPredicate`.
`setPredicate` updates the `filteredList` in `model` to contain all the internship applications that contain the keyword.

<br></br>

### Filter internship applications

The implementation of the filter command follows the convention of a normal command, where `AddressBookParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string into an executable command.
`AddressBookParser` creates `FilterCommandParser` to parse user input string.

<puml src="diagrams/FilterSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="FilterSequenceDiagram"/>

`AddressBookParser` first obtains the status from the user's input.
`AddressBookParser` ensures that the status is found. If there is no status found, `AddressBookParser` throws a ParseException.

Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `FilterCommand` that corresponds to the user input.
`FilterCommand` comprises of a `StatusPredicate`.

Upon execution, `FilterCommand` passes the instance of `StatusPredicate` to the model through the method `model::updateFilteredList`. The model then uses the predicate internally to update the displayed list of internship applications.

<br></br>

### Sort internship application list
The implementation of the command follows the convention of a normal command, where `AddressBookParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string into an executable command.
In this case, `AddressBookParser` creates `SortCommandParser` to parse user input string.

<puml src="diagrams/SortSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="SortSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` first obtains the order from the user's input.
`AddressBookParser` ensures that there is only 1 keyword found which is the sorting order. If there is no valid keyword found, `AddressBookParser` throws a ParseException.
Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `SortCommand` that corresponds to the user input.
`SortCommand` comprises of a DateComparator which contains the sorting order, according to date of application, that the internship application list should be sorted by.

Upon execution, `SortCommand` calls on `model::sortFilteredList` which in turns calls on `addressBook::sortItems`.
`sortItems` updates the `filteredList` in `model` to sort the internship applications in the list according to the order specified by the user.

<br></br>

### Clear
The implementation of the command follows the convention of a normal command, where `AddressBookParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string into an executable command.

<puml src="diagrams/ClearSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ClearSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` creates `ClearCommand`. 
Upon execution, `ClearCommand` calls on `model::setAddressBook` with a new address book that has zero internship applications. Finally, `ClearCommand` generates a `CommandResult` with a confirmation message.
> **_NOTE:_** The sequence diagram shows a simplified execution of the ClearCommand.

<br></br>

### View chart
The implementation of the chart command follows the convention of a normal command, where `AddressBookParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string into an executable command.

<puml src="diagrams/ChartSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ChartSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` creates `ChartCommand`.
Upon execution, `ChartCommand` gets the chart data which is encapsulated in `CommandResult`

<br></br>

### Close the application
The implementation of the command follows the convention of a normal command, where `AddressBookParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string into an executable command.

<puml src="diagrams/ExitSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ExitSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` creates `ExitCommand`
Upon execution, `ExitCommand` encapsulates the intent to close the application in `CommandResult`.

> **_NOTE:_** `Model` is not invoked here but included for the sake of clarity.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**
The team consists of 5 members.
Given below are enhancements planned for future versions. <br>

1. **Make 'Roles' and 'Company Names' less restrictive:** The current validator is too restrictive on what is allowed as `Role` and `Company Name`. 
Valid roles such as: C++ Developer, C# Developer, R&D Specialist are currently flagged as invalid by the validator. 
Similarly, valid company names such as: A*STAR, SK-II, Yahoo!, John's Bakery are also flagged as invalid by the validator. 
We plan to loosen the restrictions for roles and company names, to be more inclusive of the possible roles and company names in the real world. <br>

2. **Improve consistency in `find` feature:** Currently, while we prevent special characters in the `Company Name` (such as ~\`!@#),  
we did not prevent the same characters from being used as keywords for the `find` feature. This leads to an inconsistent user experience, 
since these characters would never be found in company names. We plan to be more consistent, 
and check whether the keywords provided to the `find` command are valid characters that are allowed in `Company Name`. <br>

3. **Make error message for `add` command more specific:** Currently, the error message provided when the user inputs an invalid `add` command is too generic. 
For example, `/add n/Google r/SWE d/01/01/24` will provide an error message stating `Invalid command format!`. It does not provide additional information to the user, 
on why the command is invalid. It could be improved to state the email field is missing. 
We plan to improve the validator to be able to detect specifically why the command is invalid, and provide a more specific error message. <br>

4. **Improve UI to deal with long texts:** The current application does not allow the user to scroll the list displayed on the application. 
If there is a very long text, the text will be cut off and the use would have to maximise the application's window in order to see the full text. 
We plan to implement scroll bars within the list displayed in the application, to allow the user to scroll and see any long texts. <br>

5. **Improve the validator for `email`:** The current email validator flags valid emails as invalid, such as `faceb__k@fb.com.sg`. This could cause some inconvenience to the users. 
We plan to fix the validator for email to allow for more valid emails. <br>
