## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed on your computer.

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/releases/tag/v1.5).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your HireMe.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar hireme.jar` command to run the application.<br>

    <br>A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. (e.g. typing **`/help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.)<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `/list` : Lists all your internship applications.

    * `/add n/Google r/Software Engineer Intern e/google@gmail.com d/16/09/24` : Adds an internship application at Google to HireMe.

    * `/delete 1` : Deletes the 1st internship application shown in the current list.

    * `/clear` : Deletes all your internship applications.

    * `/chart` : Shows a pie chart with your applications' statistics.

    * `/exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME r/ROLE`, `r/ROLE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `/help`, `/list`, `/exit`, `/clear` and `/chart`) will be ignored.<br>
  (e.g. if the command specifies `/help 123`, it will be interpreted as `/help`.)

</box>

### Viewing help : `/help`

* `ROLE` must be alphanumeric except `/`.
* `EMAIL` must be a valid email address.
* The `DATE` must be within the year 2000 and 2099. It also cannot be a future date which means that the date used must be before today or today's date.
* It must be in the format `dd/mm/yy`, and each field must be double digits (e.g. 01 is valid while 1 is not)

Examples:
* `/add n/Google r/Software Engineer Intern e/google@gmail.com d/16/09/24`

### Deleting an internship application : `/delete`

* The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed internship application list.
* The `INDEX` **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* The `INDEX` **must be a valid index number** (e.g. 5 is not valid when there is less than 5 applications).

Examples:
* `/list` followed by `/delete 2` deletes the 2nd application in the list.
* `/find Google` followed by `/delete 1` deletes the 1st application in the results of the `/find` command.
* `/list` followed by `/delete 4` when you only have 3 internship applications returns `The internship application index provided is invalid`.

<br>

### Finding applications by company name: `/find`

Format: `/find PATTERN`

* The search is **case-insensitive**. e.g. `goo` will match `Google`.
* The search is **only for company names**.
* The search uses **prefix search**.

  whose companies have words starting with `go` in their names.

Examples:
* `/find Goo` returns `Google` and `Google 2`
* `/find face` returns `Facebook`
* `/find app` returns `Apple`, but not `CashApp`
* `/find young` returns `Ernest & Young`

<br>

### Updating the status of an internship application : `/accept`, `/pending`, `/reject`

Updates the status of the specified internship application to `ACCEPTED`, `PENDING`, or `REJECTED`.

Formats:
- `/accept INDEX`: Changes the status to `ACCEPTED`.
- `/pending INDEX`: Changes the status to `PENDING`.
- `/reject INDEX`: Changes the status to `REJECTED`.

* The `INDEX` **must be a positive integer** (e.g. 1, 2, 3, …​)
* The `INDEX` **must be a valid index number** (e.g. 5 is not valid when there is less than 5 applications)

Examples:
* `/list` followed by `/accept 2` marks the status of the 2nd application in the list as accepted.
* `/pending 3` changes the status of the 3rd application in the current list to pending.
* `/reject 1` changes the status of the 1st application in the current list to rejected.
* `/list` followed by `/accept 4` when you only have 3 internship applications returns `The internship application index provided is invalid`.

<br>

### Filtering internship applications by status: `/filter`

Filters all of your existing internship applications with specified status.

Format: `/filter STATUS`

* Valid statuses are `pending`, `accepted` or `rejected` only.
* The status is case-insensitive. (e.g. `"pending"`, `"PenDiNg"` and `"PENDING"` are all allowed.)

Examples:
* `/filter pending` displays all the internship applications that have a status of pending.
* `/filter accepted` displays all the internship applications that have a status of accepted.
* `/filter rejected` displays all the internship applications that have a status of rejected.

<br>

### Sorting internship applications: `/sort`

Sorts your internship applications in **ascending / descending** order based on the date of application.

Format: `/sort ORDER`

* There are only 2 orders that are valid: `earliest` or `latest` only.
* The order is case-insensitive. (e.g. `"earliest"`, `"eaRLiEsT"` and `"EARLIEST"` are all allowed.)
* Once you sort the list, even if you exit the application and reopen it, the list remains sorted unless you add more internship applications.

Examples:
* `/sort earliest` displays the internship application list sorted according to the earliest applications first.
* `/sort latest` displays the internship application list sorted according to the latest applications first.

<br>

### Clearing all entries : `/clear`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ
#### Q1: Where is the data for the application stored?
Ans: HireMe data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/hireme.json`. You can make a backup of the file if you wish to.

#### Q2: Can I edit the data file directly?
Ans: You should not be editing the JSON data file directly. You should be using the commands as mentioned above to augment any data.
Should the data file be corrupted, HireMe will discard all data and start with an empty data file.

#### Q3: Can I find followed by filter to filter out the applications with a specific keyword?
Ans: Currently, `/find` and `/filter` do not stack. These commands will find or filter based on all of your internship application entries.

#### Q4: After I sort my internship applications, will a new entry be added in the right order automatically?
Ans: New entries will not be inserted in the right order. They are inserted to the bottom of the list.

#### Q5: Will adding / deleting new entries or changing the statuses of existing entries be reflected in the pie chart?
Ans: Yes! You are not required to close the window. Any changes made will be reflected immediately in the pie chart.
